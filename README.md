# Password-Manager

Trying Making a project that uses markup and programming language together

### Making just a basic password manager first (Completed)
  1. Ask about whether to generate, save or retrieve the password
  2. Make proper functions and make user-friendly interactive ways

### Navigate using the website name not the username as a person can have multiple accounts with the same username (Nearly Completed)

### Add privacy while writing password, no one can see that you wrote

### Add encryption and decryption to the saved password and give the option to make its key to the user

### Add a feature where it can work with HTML and looks good

### Add an encrypted password to the Excel file instead of text and provide an option to import it to the browser
